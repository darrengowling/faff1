The previous AI engineer focused intensively on establishing production readiness by fixing critical architectural weaknesses related to E2E testability. The work began by addressing immediate compilation errors caused by improper  imports and restoring corrupt component files (, ). The core strategy evolved from simple testid implementation to enforcing testability at the compile and runtime levels. Key achievements include creating TypeScript  wrappers that mandate  usage, developing route-based testid contract tests (RTL), implementing a backend API endpoint () for CI/runtime verification, and establishing robust CI gating scripts. The final effort involved implementing stable DOM patterns by keeping critical elements mounted but visually disabled during loading, resolving long-standing issues where elements disappeared during testing flows. This comprehensive approach shifts testability from an optional implementation detail to a mandatory, enforced standard, concluding with stable components and a working verification pipeline.

The Friends of PIFA application is an auction platform for 4-8 friends to bid on Champions League clubs, featuring magic-link authentication, league creation, live auction, and budget management.

The primary objective for the previous development cycle was to achieve production readiness, specifically by increasing the E2E test pass rate to a target of 85%. This required robust implementation and verification of  attributes across all critical flows.

**Implemented Features/Fixes:**
1.  **Codebase Stability:** Fixed core compilation issues and restored corrupted layout/component files.
2.  **TestID Consolidation:** Migrated all  definitions to a canonical, centralized file ().
3.  **Testability Enforcement:** Implemented TypeScript wrapper components (, , etc.) that enforce the presence of  at compile time.
4.  **Verification Pipeline:** Created runtime verification tooling, including a dedicated backend  endpoint () and React Testing Library (RTL) contract tests.
5.  **DOM Stability:** Refactored critical UI components (Login, Create League) to use stable DOM patterns, ensuring elements are disabled () but remain mounted during loading phases instead of being unmounted/hidden via .

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Testability Enforcement:** Using TypeScript interfaces () to mandate  usage.
-   **Stable DOM Pattern:** Employing CSS rules (, , ) instead of conditional rendering to preserve elements in the DOM during test runs.
-   **CI Gating:** Utilizing Node scripts () and environment checks () to fail the pipeline early if critical contracts (testids, config) are broken.
-   **RTL Contract Testing:** Using Jest/RTL to verify critical testid presence on key routes quickly, independent of the E2E environment.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React/Vite frontend, a FastAPI Python backend, and MongoDB.



-   ****: Canonical source of all . Updated to include navigation (, etc.), CTA, and section testids, addressing previous E2E failures.
-   ** (NEW)**: TypeScript wrappers (, , , ) that require a  prop, enforcing testability at compile time and supporting stable disabled/loading states.
-   ****: Critical file defining routes and core league logic. Modified to import  and replace native HTML elements (in ,  button) with these components, ensuring testability during loading/creation flows.
-   ****: Refactored to use  and  for email and submission, ensuring both remain mounted but disabled during API calls (), adhering to stable DOM patterns.
-   ****: Added  endpoint within the  block to allow automated scripts and verification tools to programmatically check if the required critical testids are present for a given frontend route.
-   ** (NEW)**: Jest/RTL test suite that dynamically iterates over critical routes (defined in ) to ensure testid presence before expensive E2E runs.
-   ****: Modified to include CSS rules to support deterministic hiding of testable elements, using  and  instead of removing them from the DOM.
-   ****: Updated  to include missing links (, , ) to align the application's actual navigation structure with E2E test expectations.

<pending_tasks>
- Achieve the target E2E pass rate of 85%. (Last measured at 51.9% after stable DOM fixes, requiring a final comprehensive E2E verification).
- Continue auditing and implementing  across the remaining complex components, if required by future testing.

<current_work>
The immediate work before the trajectory concluded was implementing **Stable DOM Patterns** to ensure critical components remain visible/present in the DOM for reliable E2E testing, even during loading or disabled states.

This involved:
1.  **CSS Updates:** Modifying  to define a global rule:  and enhancing styles for elements that are disabled.
2.  ** Enhancement:** Updated the custom Testable components to handle loading and disabled states gracefully, making them suitable for use in stable DOM patterns.
3.  **Component Refactoring:**
    *   : Refactored input fields and the submit button to use  and , ensuring they are always mounted but set to  during authentication attempts.
    *   : Applied similar refactoring to the  inputs and the Start Auction button, maintaining their DOM presence during loading or disabled conditions.

The final action (M689) was generating documentation for stable DOM patterns, and the application build was successful (M676). The system is now structurally ready for reliable E2E testing.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Run the comprehensive frontend E2E test suite to verify the achieved pass rate now that structural testability and DOM stability are enforced.
