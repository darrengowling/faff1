The trajectory documents the evolution of a full-stack football auction application from a buggy MVP to a near production-ready state. The initial focus was on achieving an 85% E2E test pass rate by fixing UI inconsistencies ( conventions) and frontend bugs. Frustration with complexity led to a major architectural simplification: the removal of the entire marketing portion of the site, streamlining the app's focus.

Development then pivoted to fixing core user-reported functional issues. A non-functional email invitation system was replaced with a simpler copy invite code feature. Subsequent user testing revealed critical bugs preventing the core auction flow from starting. The AI engineer diagnosed these issues, which included database field name mismatches (uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) vs ) and, most significantly, a series of complex WebSocket (Socket.IO) implementation problems.

The final phase involved an intensive, iterative effort to stabilize the real-time auction functionality. This progressed from fixing broken connection paths and authentication failures to implementing a robust, fault-tolerant Socket.IO client with an ASGI overlay pattern on the backend. The work concluded mid-refactor, creating a unified socket factory to be used across the application, as per the user's direct request for cleaner code.

The primary goal is to deliver a stable, production-ready Friends of PIFA football club auction application. The core user journey involves a league commissioner creating a league, inviting friends using a simple invite code, and running a live, real-time auction where all participants can bid on teams.

Initial requirements focused on an 85% E2E test pass rate, but this evolved to prioritize fixing tangible user-facing bugs and ensuring a seamless core experience.

**Key Features & Fixes Implemented:**
- **Simplified Architecture:** The entire marketing website was removed, focusing the application solely on the auction functionality. The app now directs users to login or the dashboard.
- **Functional Invitation System:** An initial, broken email invitation system was replaced with a reliable invite code system. Users can generate a code, share it, and new members can join a league easily.
- **Stable Real-Time Auctions:** After extensive debugging of WebSocket (Socket.IO) connectivity, authentication, and state synchronization, the live auction system is now functional. This includes real-time updates for bidding, timers, and league lobby events.
- **Robust Reconnection:** The application now supports automatic reconnection and state synchronization, ensuring that users who refresh their browser or experience network drops can rejoin the auction without losing their place.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Monorepo Architecture:** A React/Vite frontend communicates with a Python/FastAPI backend.
- **Real-Time Communication (Socket.IO):** Extensively used for live auction updates and lobby synchronization. The implementation evolved to use an ASGI overlay pattern on the backend and a robust, auto-fallback client on the frontend.
- **E2E Testing (Playwright):** Used to validate UI stability and core user flows, driving many of the initial bug fixes.
- **Architectural Simplification:** A major refactoring effort removed the marketing site, simplifying routing in  and reducing overall complexity.

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. The architecture is centered around a main  file that handles routing and contains many of the core components as inline definitions. Real-time functionality is managed through a dedicated Socket.IO client library and corresponding backend handlers.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This file contains the new, unified socket factory responsible for creating and managing the application's single Socket.IO connection. It includes logic for automatic reconnection, state synchronization (), and path resolution.
    -   **Changes:** This file was newly created at the user's request to consolidate all socket logic into a reusable, clean factory pattern, replacing disparate connection logic in  and .

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main entry point for the React application, containing all client-side routing and defining many core components inline, such as  and .
    -   **Changes:** Heavily modified throughout the trajectory. The  component was updated to use the new unified socket factory from  to manage real-time updates for joining users. It also had a polling mechanism as a temporary fix before full WebSocket implementation. The routing was simplified by removing the marketing site.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The core component for the live auction experience. It handles all real-time event listeners for bidding, timers, and auction state changes.
    -   **Changes:** This file underwent significant refactoring to fix broken Socket.IO connections. Multiple conflicting connection attempts were consolidated, and token authentication logic was added to resolve connection hangs. It still needs to be updated to use the new unified socket factory.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main FastAPI application file. It defines all REST API endpoints and Socket.IO event handlers.
    -   **Changes:** The Socket.IO setup was completely refactored to use an ASGI overlay pattern, moving the connection path from a custom  to the standard . This change was critical to resolve ingress routing issues and stabilize real-time connections. Event handlers for  and  were added.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance:** These files contain the core business logic for auctions and league management.
    -   **Changes:** Fixed a critical bug where the  for auctions was not being created, preventing auctions from starting. Also addressed a timezone-related bug that could cause timer inconsistencies in live auctions. Socket.IO  calls were added to notify clients of state changes.

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete the Socket Factory Refactor:** The  component still uses its own local socket connection logic. It needs to be updated to use the new, unified socket factory from  to ensure consistent and reliable real-time communication.
- **Update AuctionRoom on mount:** The  component must be updated to call the  function from the new socket factory when the component mounts.
</pending_tasks>
<current_work>
The most recent task was a direct implementation of a user request to refactor the entire client-side Socket.IO management into a single, unified factory. This was done to improve code quality, reduce redundancy, and ensure consistent real-time behavior across the application.

The AI engineer created a new file, , containing a  function. This factory handles establishing the connection, setting the correct path (), and automatically managing reconnection logic. Crucially, it exposes a  method and is configured to automatically rejoin a user to their last active league (using ) upon connection or reconnection.

Immediately after creating this new factory, the engineer began integrating it into the application. The  component (defined inside ) was the first to be refactored. The old, direct  call was replaced with an import from the new  factory, and its  hook was updated to use the  method. The work stopped immediately after successfully refactoring this first component. The next logical step is to apply the same refactoring to the  component.
