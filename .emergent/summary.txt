The previous AI engineer executed a comprehensive strategy to achieve production readiness by enforcing robust E2E testing contracts. The primary focus was auditing, consolidating, and enforcing the use of  attributes. Key activities included restoring corrupted components (, ), migrating all testid imports to a canonical file (), and fixing navigation and CTA testid mismatches to improve E2E pass rates (reaching 78.6% before further architectural changes). A major architectural shift involved creating TypeScript wrapper components (, ) to enforce testid presence at compile time. Furthermore, a CI gate mechanism was built: a backend endpoint () and a corresponding audit script () to prevent deployment when critical testids are missing. The DOM stability was enhanced by implementing patterns to keep critical elements mounted (using disabled/loading states instead of unmounting). The work concluded while refactoring Playwright E2E tests to use a canonical selector registry (), which required identifying and adding missing  related testids to the central registry.

<product_requirements>
The Friends of PIFA application is a commissioner-led auction platform for bidding on Champions League clubs, featuring magic-link authentication, league management, live auction, and leaderboards. The overriding requirement is achieving production readiness through robust E2E testing, targeting an 85% E2E pass rate. This required establishing reliable authentication with deterministic loading states, fixing UI/UX issues (consistent headers, deterministic anchor navigation, reliable mobile drawer), ensuring stable backend API handling (sequential MongoDB operations), and stable Socket.IO connections. The main implementation objective was creating a rigid contract for E2E reliability, including: consolidating all s into a single source of truth, enforcing their presence via TypeScript wrappers, developing an automated DOM verification system (backend endpoint + CI script), and implementing stable DOM patterns to ensure critical elements remain mounted during state changes.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Testing Enforcement**: TypeScript wrappers () requiring  for critical components.
- **CI Gates**: Backend verification endpoint () used by a CI audit script ().
- **Stable DOM**: Components maintain presence (mounted) using  or  states for E2E predictability.
- **Testing Frameworks**: React Testing Library (RTL) contract tests and Playwright E2E testing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React (Vite) frontend and a FastAPI (Python) backend with MongoDB.



- ****: Canonical source for all  values ( constant). Updated repeatedly to consolidate missing testids like section IDs, CTA IDs (), and navigation items.
- ** (NEW)**: Core enforcement mechanism. Defines , , , etc., which utilize TypeScript to mandate the  attribute, improving compile-time safety. Also supports stable DOM patterns (e.g., handling  state).
- ****: Key components (like ) were updated to use  and  and incorporate disabled/loading states for stable DOM.
- ****: Refactored to use  and  to ensure the email input and submit button remain mounted but disabled during loading/submission states.
- ** (NEW)**: Jest/RTL tests that verify that all testids required by  are present and unique on their respective routes.
- ****: Added a mock verification endpoint  within the  block. This endpoint is used by CI/testing tools to check if critical testids are accessible.
- ** (NEW)**: Central registry for Playwright selectors, exporting  to enforce the use of canonical  throughout E2E specs.
- **E2E Specs (, , etc.)**: Currently being updated to use  instead of raw strings or ad-hoc  imports.
- ****: Being refactored to use the new  helper, specifically in functions like  and .

<pending_tasks>
- **Continue E2E Selector Refactoring**: Complete the migration of all E2E test files and utility functions ( and various specs) to exclusively use the  helper from .
- **Verify E2E Pass Rate**: Run the comprehensive E2E test suite after selector refactoring to ensure the 85% pass rate target is met.

<current_work>
The immediate work being performed is the refactoring of E2E test utilities to use the canonical selector registry. This was initiated by creating  which provides the  helper. The engineer successfully updated several E2E specification files (, , ).

While working on refactoring , the engineer discovered that the required testids for the create league buttons (, ) were missing from the canonical  file. The engineer fixed this discrepancy by adding them to .

The last operation was fixing the  helper function in  to use the newly enforced  selector:

The trajectory ended immediately after the successful edit to  to incorporate the new selectors. The goal is to fully eliminate ad-hoc selectors from E2E tests.

<optional_next_step>
Continue updating the remaining Playwright E2E helper functions in  to use the canonical  selector helper.
