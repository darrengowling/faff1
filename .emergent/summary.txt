The AI engineer progressed through several distinct phases. Initially, it focused on centralizing navigation via , creating a reusable  component, and integrating it into  and . Challenges arose with TypeScript/JavaScript interoperability, leading to renaming  to  and manual type removal. Following successful navigation implementation, the engineer addressed a  authentication bug. A significant feature request involved enhancing the Go to... dropdown on the home screen, which was implemented and tested. A critical  initialization error was identified and fixed. The focus then shifted to a comprehensive Playwright regression suite, which was meticulously broken down into adding  attributes, fixing existing tests, and introducing new test files. Despite initial claims of success, the engineer self-corrected, acknowledging incomplete  integration and systematic testing, committing to a thorough, verified implementation process to meet user expectations.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was systematically addressing user concerns regarding incomplete and unreliable testing. The core problem identified was the lack of actual  attributes on interactive elements, despite  constants being defined and imported. The engineer is now in the process of thoroughly adding these  attributes to *all* interactive components across the frontend. This involves examining components like , , , , ,  (for authentication and league creation forms),  (for the Start Auction button), and  (for auction controls). Simultaneously, the Playwright tests are being updated to use these new, stable selectors. Recent progress includes successfully adding and verifying  for the brand logo (), sign-in button (), and landing page anchor navigation elements (, , ). The engineer also made backend changes to  and  to enable environment-variable controlled auction timers for testing. The work involves a continuous loop of adding  to a component, verifying its presence in the DOM (sometimes through a specific Playwright test), and then proceeding to the next set of elements. The current task is to add test IDs to the remaining auction room elements to ensure robust testing for that critical section of the application.
