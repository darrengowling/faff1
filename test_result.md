# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

FINDINGS: 1) ✅ INFRASTRUCTURE CORRECT - All sections found with correct testids (section-home, section-how, section-why, section-features, section-safety, section-faq), CSS .anchor-section classes implemented on all 6 sections, navigation tabs exist with proper onclick handlers, 2) ❌ HASH UPDATES ON CLICKS FAILING - Navigation tab clicks (tab-how, tab-why, tab-faq) do not update URL hash from #home to target sections, tabs are clickable and scroll sections into view but hash remains stuck at #home, 3) ❌ SCROLL SPY INCONSISTENT - Manual scrolling sometimes updates hash (saw #how, #why updates) but behavior is unreliable and doesn't consistently trigger on 50% visibility threshold, 4) ✅ MANUAL FUNCTION CALLS WORK - Direct scrollToSection() function calls successfully update hash and scroll correctly, suggesting React event binding issues rather than function logic problems. ROOT CAUSE: Navigation tab onClick handlers are not properly calling scrollToSection function despite having onclick attributes. This appears to be a React event binding or component lifecycle issue preventing the click events from executing the hash update logic."

PASS RATE: 37/58 tests passed (63.8% success rate). ✅ SUCCESSFUL SPECS: Authentication UI Tests (8/10 passed) - login form rendering, email validation, magic link flow working correctly; Landing Page Tests (13/15 passed) - page title, main sections, hero CTAs, anchor scrolling, responsive design all functional; Navigation Tests (16/18 passed) - desktop navigation, product dropdown, anchor links working correctly. ❌ REMAINING FAILURES: Mobile navigation issues (hamburger menu blocked by sticky nav overlay), some auth UI edge cases (loading state, dead ends), core-smoke test timeout on league creation flow. 🔧 KEY ISSUES IDENTIFIED: 1) Email validation rejecting .test domains causing test failures, 2) CSS overlay interference blocking mobile menu interactions, 3) League creation flow timing issues in automated tests. OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Core functionality working well with 63.8% pass rate, primary issues are UI polish and test environment configuration rather than fundamental application failures."

    message: "🎉 CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION ISSUE RESOLVED - CORE-SMOKE TEST UNBLOCKED: Successfully identified and fixed the root cause of core-smoke.spec.ts timeout on Create League CTA. ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Test-login endpoint was setting HTTP-only cookies but authentication middleware only checked Authorization headers, causing 403 'Not authenticated' errors. FIXES IMPLEMENTED: 1) Backend auth.py - Modified get_current_user() to check both Authorization headers AND cookies for token, made HTTPBearer optional (auto_error=False), 2) Backend server.py - Fixed test-login cookie settings (secure=True, proper domain), 3) Frontend App.js - Added axios.defaults.withCredentials=true and modified AuthProvider to attempt user fetch even without localStorage token. VERIFICATION COMPLETED: ✅ Test-login endpoint returns 200 with user data, ✅ /api/auth/me returns 200 with authenticated user, ✅ Navigation to /app successfully reaches dashboard (no redirect to /login), ✅ User sees 'Welcome, commish@example.com' and dashboard content, ✅ Create League buttons are visible and accessible.

BLOCKING SPEC #1: auth_ui.spec.ts - Authentication flow completely broken due to backend EmailNotValidError (AttributeError: module 'email_validator' has no attribute 'EmailNotValidError'), causing 500 server errors and preventing all authentication-dependent tests. BLOCKING SPEC #2: core-smoke.spec.ts - Create League button timeout (15000ms exceeded) due to authentication session persistence issues, blocking all end-to-end user flows. BLOCKING SPEC #3: landing-page.spec.js - Navigation interception issues where header elements block tab clicks (pointer events intercepted), causing anchor scroll tests to fail. ROOT CAUSES: 1) Backend dependency issue with email_validator module, 2) Authentication session management failures, 3) CSS z-index/pointer-events conflicts in navigation. IMPACT: 70%+ of test suite blocked by authentication failures, preventing comprehensive E2E validation.

Created /app/tests/e2e/utils/league.ts with fillCreateLeague() that handles both CreateLeagueDialog (dashboard modal with input fields) and CreateLeagueWizard (page with select fields). Updated helpers.ts createLeague() to use type-aware form filling. Fixed testid conflict by changing App.js create-slots to create-slots-input. Form detection and filling now works correctly: detects dialog vs wizard forms, uses appropriate testids, fills all fields successfully (slots, budget, min, max).

Frontend fixes: 1) Updated LoginPage.jsx to handle structured 400 error responses with proper auth-error display, 2) E2E helpers now default to login({ mode:'test' }) for CI stability, 3) Added loginUI helper for testing actual auth flow. Test fixes: 1) Updated access_and_gates.spec.ts to use test login by default, 2) Added UI magic-link sub-test that asserts 400 on invalid input with proper error handling, 3) Added request interception to prevent Axios unhandled rejections.
