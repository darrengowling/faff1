BREAKING CHANGE: The request './App' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified (probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '\"type\": \"module\"'). The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified. Add the extension to the request."
