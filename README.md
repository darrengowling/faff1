- **Connection Status**: Real-time connection indicator in the UI
- **State Restoration**: Server snapshots restore auction state on reconnect
- **Presence Tracking**: See who's online/offline in real-time
- **Heartbeat System**: Maintains connection health with 30s intervals

### Connection Indicators

- ðŸ”´ **Offline**: Connection failed (refresh required)

### Troubleshooting Connections

If you experience connection issues:

1. **Check your internet connection**
